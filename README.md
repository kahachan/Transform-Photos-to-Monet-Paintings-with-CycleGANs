Mentee assignment from IBM Advance AI @ Infinite Learning Course completion of Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM from CognitiveClass.ai

## Overview

Welcome to the "Transform Photos to Monet Paintings with CycleGANs" repository! This project is a mentee assignment from the IBM Advance AI program, building upon the completion of the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM" course from CognitiveClass.ai. In this project, we delve into the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and specifically explore CycleGANs to transform ordinary photos into artwork resembling the style of renowned artist Claude Monet.

### Key Features

- **CycleGAN Implementation**: Learn how to implement a CycleGAN model using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning library.

- **Photo to Monet Transformation**: Explore the process of transforming photos into paintings in the distinctive style of Claude Monet.

- **Tech Stack Integration**: Leverage a versatile tech stack, including NumPy for mathematical operations, Pillow for image processing functions, TensorFlow for machine learning and neural network-related functions, and Matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
